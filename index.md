### Linear-regression
  I developed a linear regression model in Python to help determine whether or not people have disabilities.

### Logistic-Regression
   In Python, I created a logistic regression model that considers age, gender, passenger status, and other variables to decide the probability of survival. To help people understand why the columns are relevant, I used different graphs to illustrate results. I choose the column and train the model on its performance or value. The accuracy of the model is 77%.
   
### Random-Forest-Algorithm
   Random-Forest-Algorithm I used the random forest algorithm to find the bank note authentication in this project. In this case, I used Photos of genuine and forged banknote-like specimens were used to obtain information. An industrial camera, usually used for print inspection, was used for digitization. The final images have a resolution of 400x400 pixels. Gray-scale picturing is possible due to the object lens and distance to the examined object. It was possible to obtain images with a resolution of about 660 dpi. To extract features from images, the Wavelet Transform method was used.
