**Title: Telecom Churn (Linear Regression)**
- **Problem Statement:** Built a ML model to predict churn for a leading telecom operator in South-East Asia.
- **Steps Followed:**
  - Loading Modules & Libraries.
  - Loading dataset.
  - Data Preparation.
  - Filter high-value customers.
  - EDA- Pre-process data (convert columns to appropriate formats, handle missing values, etc.).
  - Stats for potential Categorical datatype columns.
  - Conduct appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modelling/feature engineering).
  - Replacing NAN values.
  - PCA: Principal Component Analysis.

**Title: Melanoma Detection (CNN)**
- **Problem Statement:** Build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- **Steps Followed:**
  - Implementing a multiclass classification model on Skin cancer dataset using a custom model in Tensorflow.
  - Load the data.
  - EDA.
  - Up sampling function for imbalanced data.
  - Down sampling function for imbalanced data.
  - Get the class indices.
  - Create the model.
  - Define the model architecture.
  - Compile the model.
  - Train the model.
  - Test model.
  - RocAuc Score.
  - Performance curves.
  - Confusion Matrix.

**Title: Automatic Ticket Classification (NLP)**
- **Problem Statement:** Create a model that can automatically classify customer complaints based on the products and services that the ticket mentions.
- **Steps Followed:**
  - Text in Description is pre-processed by removing unwanted characters and words. Some descriptions are given in other languages which are translated to English internally.
  - Stop words are removed, and all the words are lemmatized.
  - With this pre-processed description, the words in the corpus are tokenized, and embeddings were created with word2vec. Embedding was also generated with glove.
  - Different NLP algorithms were tried out - RNN, LSTM, GRU, Traditional ML algorithms such as Random Forest and SVM.
  - Model can classify the IT tickets with 91.24% accuracy.

**Title: Bank Note Authentication Using Random Forest Algorithm**
   - **Project Description:** The aim of this project is to determine the authenticity of bank notes. Using certain features such as variance, skewness, curtsies, and entropy, all of the features are fed into the Random Forest algorithm, and the model determines whether the note is authenticated or not. This algorithm has a 90% accuracy rate.
   - **Front End:** Python, Flask
   - **Backend:** Python, Flask, Pickle, pandas, numpy, sklearn
   - **Key Role:**

**Title: Chances of Surviving The Titanic, which sank in the Atlantic Ocean**
   - **Project Description:** To determine the likelihood of survival, I developed a logistic regression algorithm that takes into account age, gender, passenger status, and other variables. I used various graphs to explain findings to help people understand why the columns are important. I pick a column and train the model based on its output or significance. The model's accuracy is 77 percent.
