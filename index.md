## Machine Learning 

### Linear-regression
  I developed a linear regression model in Python to help determine whether or not people have disabilities.

### Logistic-Regression
   In Python, I created a logistic regression model that considers age, gender, passenger status, and other variables to decide the probability of survival. To help people understand why the columns are relevant, I used different graphs to illustrate results. I choose the column and train the model on its performance or value. The accuracy of the model is 77%.
   
### Random-Forest-Algorithm
   Random-Forest-Algorithm I used the random forest algorithm to find the bank note authentication in this project. In this case, I used Photos of genuine and forged banknote-like specimens were used to obtain information. An industrial camera, usually used for print inspection, was used for digitization. The final images have a resolution of 400x400 pixels. Gray-scale picturing is possible due to the object lens and distance to the examined object. It was possible to obtain images with a resolution of about 660 dpi. To extract features from images, the Wavelet Transform method was used.


## PROJECTS

**1. Bank Note Authentication Using Random Forest Algorithm**
   - **Project Description:** The aim of this project is to determine the authenticity of bank notes. Using certain features such as variance, skewness, curtsies, and entropy, all of the features are fed into the Random Forest algorithm, and the model determines whether the note is authenticated or not. This algorithm has a 90% accuracy rate.
   - **Front End:** Python, Flask
   - **Backend:** Python, Flask, Pickle, pandas, numpy, sklearn
   - **Key Role:**
     - UI Design.
     - Data Cleaning Features Selection.
     - Model Creation and Deployment.

**2. Chances of Surviving The Titanic, which sank in the Atlantic Ocean**
   - **Project Description:** To determine the likelihood of survival, I developed a logistic regression algorithm that takes into account age, gender, passenger status, and other variables. I used various graphs to explain findings to help people understand why the columns are important. I pick a column and train the model based on its output or significance. The model's accuracy is 77 percent.
